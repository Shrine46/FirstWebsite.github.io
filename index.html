                    <p class="grey-large">I <b>LOVE <i>David Bowie's</i></b> music, not only is it really nice to listen to it is also very enjoyable to relisten to the same song over and over again. This is due to the fact that his music holds lots of meaning in each word (or no meaning at all), this makes listening to it a fun experience as you feel like you can connect with the artist, not to mention his legacy and what he stood for.</p>

                <p>
                    <p class="grey-large">Now I understand that this, as well as #1 are basic, but the reason why these choices are basic are becuase they are simply the best, Elton John revolutionized his certain genera and gave way to many new aspiering artists while producing some of the best songs</p>

                <p>
                    <p class="grey-large">this is a more recent discovery in my music taste, I have been loving most but not all of his songs due to them having really nice <i>vibes</i> honestly there isn't muhc to say other than his music is just beautiful to listen to.</p>
